## Profile 
Amsterdam-based Senior DevOps Engineer with expertise in microservice design, automating deployments, monitoring services, and creating AI applications.

## Experience

### Fetch (Unicorn mobile app) — 2021-Present
**>AI and Foundational Models**
- Created batch job framework for mass refactors of our codebases using foundational models; saves hundreds of engineering hours (few-shot prompting, retrieval-augmented generation).
- Designed penetration testing framework that detects newly created public IP addresses and uses a foundational model to enrich them by retrieving OpenAPI routes, gateway proxy routes, and deployment metadata (AI as a judge, AWS Lambda).
- Created the company’s first Model Context Protocol servers that wrap internal tools. Allows developers to easily interact with tooling through human language (Typescript).

**> DevOps**
- Core maintainer of a bespoke Terraform deploy tool responsible for 1000 deploys per week across hundreds of services (Golang); participate in DevOps support of 200 engineers [CICD, troubleshooting].
- Improved velocity of machine learning engineers by using Helm charts and Karpenter to spin up/down GPU nodes as needed to serve models. Docker mirror was added to reduce image pull time; cut model deployment time by 70%.
- Administrator of Kubernetes clusters. Designed multi-cluster strategy, governance, and topology. Automated deployment of core Operators and alarms in each cluster [ArgoCD, LB, DNS, Kube State, Secrets, OPA].
- Administrator of Kafka clusters that supports 100k writes/s. Lead architect of a microservice strategy of Kafka Connect to host 250 connectors, each in isolated deployments (AWS ECS, Java).

**> Backend Engineering**
- Wrote Kafka producers and consumers to handle asynchronous communication for critical high throughput; Superbowl Ad that resulted in 1.2M signups in 2 minutes (Golang, AWS ECS).
- Architected a fault-tolerant service to perform canary/blue-green rollouts for services hosted on any platform [AWS ECS, K8s, etc] using ALB, Target Groups, listener rules (Golang).
- Wrote Feature Store API to serve S3 URIs to machine learning model training jobs; given parameters of dataset, version, and timestamps (Golang).
- Wrote ETL microservice that tails Graph Database CDC and normalizes JSON; 15k records/s (Golang, K8s Deployment).

### Aptive Resources (Government consulting) — 2020-2021
**> Data Engineering**
- Worked with clients to build highly scalable social media scraping apps that accounted for sessions and rate limiting (Kotlin, K8s Deployment).
- Created daily batch job to clean text from social media posts and comments. A scoring model picked up the clean data to vectorize and predict (sklearn, spaCy, K8s CronJob).
